        <h2>Connection</h2>
        <p>
            This direction implies two things: 1) connecting people together as closely as possible; 2) "landing," i.e., eliminating
            everything superfluous and "fake" — the virtual.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current world is filled with lies and "wrappers" without content. Lies and emptiness surround us every day, but we see them as truth and fullness.
            Therefore, we will eliminate them and reveal the truth. A new era — new demand. And in this new era of the virtual, there is only demand for reality,
            and we will satisfy this demand.

        <h2>Projects of "Connection"</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>"Internet Passport"</strong> (netpass) — a unique identifier of a person on the internet that operates on
            non-fungible technologies, aimed at cleaning the network of "bots" or completely distinguishing subjects and objects in the internet 
            (each subject — people, semi-subjects — organizations, everything else, such as bots — objects) both from each other
            and within groups. The passport is the central technology on which further projects are built.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>System &#928;</strong> (pi, Pi-system), <strong>Groups</strong>, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>"Clock"</strong> — a device that enables real-time translation of what people say to each other, 
            essentially eliminating the language barrier between different nationalities. For this purpose, AI technologies, 
            computational linguistics, and initially acoustic technologies will be used, followed by neurotechnologies.
