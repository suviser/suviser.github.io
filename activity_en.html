        <h2>Projects of "Activity"</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>"Super Organizer"</strong> — an innovative, integrated, cross-platform software aimed at complete
            subordination and organization of human activities as a whole: both work and leisure. This occurs through maximum
            simultaneous simplicity and completeness, as they say: <i>"get exactly as many 'hands' as you need"</i> — through integration
            with hardware (phone, PC), which allows recording, planning, and controlling all one’s activities from real
            to digital, as well as through the use of modern technologies, such as AI, and future technologies (for example, augmented reality glasses,
            which, by the way, is also a project of et Human).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>"Mobility"</strong> (mobile activity) — serious software that serves dual purposes, which can be better described as follows:
            <div class="quote-container">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "The future department of the company will be engaged in the development of software, operating systems, launchers, and other
                        computer and mobile programs in the broadest sense to enhance the effectiveness of the military (primarily soldiers),
                        as well as the military machine through (specifically) the creation of an information integrative (integrative) military database and
                        cloud with appropriate cyber protection and the creation of new software and/or the acquisition and/or integration of already existing software, which will adapt
                        and otherwise modify and customize mobile devices (smartphones primarily) and other accessories and devices 
                        "Inaut"* to suit military needs for the ability to use these devices outside and during combat actions."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong><i>* "Inaut" – input/output, meaning accessories that can somehow be connected to a smartphone (or another mobile device like a smartphone) to either receive and store, or transmit data.</i></strong>
                    </p>
