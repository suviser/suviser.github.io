        <h2><strong>About et Human</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>et Human</strong> &mdash; is an entrepreneurial team aimed at developing technological soft- and 
            hard-products with the goal of creating a company that will be named the same.</p>
        <p>et Human &mdash; is an attempt to integrate into the world economy to change it.</p>
        <p>In my personal opinion, humanity is entering the final stage of development,
            related to knowledge, science, AI, bio-, nano-, neuro-, and other technologies.</p>
        <p>The time is coming for the merging of people, a transition to a fundamentally new stage of development,
            when work changes its essence, and life changes its meaning. Knowledge becomes everything and defines everything, and we are united with technology.</p>
    
        <p>And the leading movement in this should be et Human. Although there are already Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and 
            others in the world, they are merely changing their specialization. et Human is intended 
            to be the most advanced technology company in the world (like OpenAI or Neuralink),
            which will use and develop the most advanced technologies and push the era forward.
            It's like the USA, which embarked on the path of capitalist development from the very beginning of its existence, taking industrial England as a basis.</p>
        <p><strong>Such is the meaning, such is my goal.</strong></p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>There are four areas of activity: 1) Knowledge; 2) Communication; 3) Activity &mdash; 4) Development.</p>

    <h3>Knowledge</h3>
    <p><strong>&laquo;Knowledge&raquo;</strong> &mdash; <span style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0;" title="* 
        daa &mdash; direction aimed at">daa*</span> <i>“to assist in the production of knowledge for man
            and humanity.”</i></p>
    <!-- <br> -->

    <p>
        The time has come to automate the creation of knowledge. Science, technology, philosophy, 
        creativity &mdash; at least one of these fields captivates each of us, even if only a little.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to accelerate the production of knowledge or even to increase the acceleration more and more on one side, 
        while also making it possible for everyone to participate in this process on the other.   
    </p>
    <p><strong><i>Knowledge is power!</i></strong></p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p><strong>“Communication”</strong> &mdash; <span style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0;" title="daa &mdash; direction aimed at">daa</span> <i>
        “to facilitate communication and the formation of connections between people.”</i></p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p>It may seem: where can we have more communication?</p>
    <p>In reality, no matter how illusory it may seem, the development of modern social networks and messengers only disconnects people and 
        creates a cult of loneliness. I find this counterproductive and contrary to human life itself.</p>
    <p>My goal is to connect people together so strongly that they never feel lonely again, which will 
        provoke a rise in productivity.</p>

    <h3>Activity</h3>
    <p><strong>“Activity”</strong> &mdash; <span style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0;" title="daa &mdash; direction aimed at">daa</span> <i>
        “to facilitate the maximization of productivity in both business and physical spheres,
        as well as convenience in personal life.”</i></p>
    <p>Activity has two goals:</p>
    <ol id="ebsp">
        <li>Increase productivity and efficiency;</li>
        <li>Improve the quality of life from all sides.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We need to enhance labor efficiency to such an extent that work itself becomes a trifle and is minimized as much as possible. 
        In their free time, a person will enjoy life and only do what brings pleasure: 
        everything will be arranged for that.</p>

    <h2>Development = Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>The mission of et Human</strong> &mdash; the technological <i>development</i> of humanity and mankind.</p>
    <p>The development of humanity until now has been a stochastic, that is, random process, 
        in some aspects even leading to degradation and degeneration.

        The time has come for a logical and irreversible development: multiplying the quantity and quality of humanity by 2, 10, 50 &mdash; 1000 times.</p>

    <p>Naturally, this is only possible thanks to modern and future technologies, 
        which at this moment exist only outside of humanity - this is the beginning.</p>
    
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p><strong>Vision</strong> &mdash; a future where humanity and technology merge into a harmonious whole.</p>
    <p>I see how humanity transforms, how its brain is augmented, how society stitches together and mutates, 
        how physical capabilities expand and multiply.</p>
    <p>Gradually, technologies envelop the body and mind, initially symbiotically, 
        and then merging with them, ultimately forming something greater.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p id="slogan">“et Human, where development merges with humanity.”</p>

    <h2>Value Principles</h2>
    <p>
        The value principles of et Human are expressed as follows:
    </p>
    <ol style="line-height: 1,5;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Simplicity</b>: The goal of et Human is to minimize complexity in every aspect, whether it is functionality or 
            design of applications, programs, software, or physical devices. The pursuit of complete ease and weightlessness 
            in perception for the client is a fundamental principle.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Perfectionism</b>: et Human strives for excellence, encompassing all possible aspects of functionality and design. 
            The task is to create a product that stands out in its perfect completeness, no more, no less.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Technologization</b>: This principle is based on the use of advanced scientific and technological achievements, 
            implementing the latest technological developments, such as IT, AI, nano-, bio-, neuro-technologies, and more.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Creativity and Innovation</b>: Each project, change, or addition is aimed at creating something new, 
            unique, and groundbreaking. et Human seeks to express creativity and innovation in every action.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Continuity of Development (Permarevolutionism)</b>: The goal is constant, uninterrupted development, turning each 
            cycle into a revolution, shaping exponential growth.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            <b>Dominance</b>: et Human and each of its projects in general strive for market dominance, distinguished not only by size and 
            power, but also in quality, innovation, technical excellence, thinking, and essence. Creating standards is 
            the goal, not just a consequence.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Stages of Development</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: -8px;">
        <strong>et Human</strong> goes through three stages of development, namely: </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
                <strong>Stage I</strong> &mdash; <strong>Abstraction</strong> (the use of AI and IT technologies, 
                Big Data, etc.) &mdash; 
                this is ZZ, in general the Triad of knowledge, Dialectics, 
                the first stage [of the book world], the System Pi, Groups, Mobility, and more (the most developed stage);
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
                <strong>Stage II</strong> &mdash; <strong>Materialization</strong> (the use of hardware, the development 
                of devices, etc.) &mdash; this is, in particular, the second stage
                [of the book world], when an innovative electronic book will be developed, and more;
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
                <strong>Stage III</strong> &mdash; <strong>Hyper-technology</strong> (the use of nano-, 
                bio-, neuro- and other technologies, as well as their combinations) &mdash; this is, in particular, 
                "The Clock" (an acoustic device that allows translating people's voices in 
                real-time without the use of 
                accessories and much more), nanomaterials, bionanomaterials, neurochips for augmented 
                reality (the next stage of the development 
                of the phone), etc. (this is a very raw stage, but it is the main one).
            </li>
            <li>
                It is important to note:
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 8px;">
                        The stages of development of et Human are not linear but cumulative: each subsequent 
                        stage implies the realization of the previous one
                        and includes it &mdash; and parallelly, when we talk about each direction 
                        (one direction may be at stage 1, another at stage 2).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stages can significantly impact other aspects of life, such as society, economy, and culture,
                        each subsequent stage has an exponentially greater effect.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
