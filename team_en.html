        <h3></h3>
        <p class="warning">
            This is a startup &mdash; the beginning of a great journey! Currently, financial resources are limited, but there is plenty of enthusiasm and ideas here. Looking for enthusiasts ready to invest their time and energy into this endeavor!

        <h2>Team Search</h2>
        <p>
            As you understand, a team is necessary, a team that can achieve everything. 
            Implementing <strong>et Nota</strong> can be done even with the laziest efforts, but 
            with adequate resources, it can be achieved in less than 1 year, or even in 1-2 quarters. The profits, despite their 
            underestimation in documents, will be colossal, which is obvious when talking about 
            technological projects.
            Life &mdash; is work, even a startup &mdash; is work (if you happen to 
            think otherwise)... And it is a unique job, which is not given to everyone, but it is worth it for everyone who participates in it. But it is undoubtedly an adventure, albeit a dangerous one, that 
            will bring unforgettable memories.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend starting with studying <a href="continue_en.html" style="color: lightskyblue;">Continue... (<strong>et Nota</strong>)</a>.
            If you understood the essence of the project and/or are very interested in it and KNOW (anything) and CAN (anything) help in its implementation, then you fit.
            And if, in addition to this, you share the views of <strong>et Human</strong> &mdash; you are an ideal fit!
