        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            Actually, this page was supposed to be about the direction of <strong>&laquo;Knowledge&raquo;</strong>, but since I have 
            a very detailed and interconnected understanding of the so-called <strong>&laquo;Triad of Knowledge&raquo;</strong>, 
            I will focus on it and briefly mention other projects as opportunities arise.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: -13px;">
            Briefly about other projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>&laquo;Dialectics&raquo;</strong> &mdash; an innovative software for 
                <strong><i>conducting disputes</i></strong>, which retains a database of certain materials (usually
                classical works of scholars), the application itself for disputes that records every word, sets limitations, 
                determines time, and much more, as well as special software for probabilistic analysis of each "dispute" 
                to derive the most likely hypotheses. In other words, &laquo;Dialectics&raquo; is the triad itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>[book world]</strong> (written in parentheses because 
                it's a code name), or <strong>&laquo;Harmony&raquo;</strong> &mdash; an innovative,
                primarily online (I don't want to use the next 
                word here, but for understanding it is necessary) "library," where you can read books interactively 
                and which consists of several subdivisions that fully cover the entire book industry.
                &laquo;Harmony&raquo; is even a pentad.
            </li>
            <li>For now, that's all.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Triad of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>&laquo;Triad of Knowledge&raquo;</strong> &mdash; 
            is a code name that encrypts a complex of three programs 
            (applications). The combination of these programs works on the same principle as 
            the human brain. Just as the human mind follows a path in the pursuit of creating knowledge, so does a person through these
            programs, facilitating each stage of creation.
        </p>

        <h3>1 &mdash; et Nota</h3>
        <p>
            It allows for precise, atomic collection of knowledge. Randomly creating an environment for reflection and recording 
            these thoughts <strong>mobilly</strong>, it enables the collection of "experience," "data," etc., in an informal 
            form, and as the volume of material becomes infinitely large, it allows for finding "gold" in the "dirt." This is a to-do project, 
            so information about it can be found at 
            <a href="continue_en.html" style="color: lightskyblue;">Continue... (<strong>et Nota</strong>)</a>
        </p>
        
        <h3>2 &mdash; Clean Sheet (Net Leaf), or Tabula Rasa</h3>
        <p>
            Next, the Clean Sheet "stitches" these pieces of knowledge together using a "graph," or "second brain" (as 
            this is somewhat realized in Obsidian). 
            Thus, atoms are combined into molecules, and those, in turn, into cells, and so on, until complete "knowledge" 
            is formed, which then goes on to "publication" or practical application.
        </p>
        <i>
            <p>
            (Additionally, the Clean Sheet can be used in the B2B segment for entire companies and corporations. It will have a corporate version, 
            which will be used by almost all employees of the company to accumulate internal "knowledge"). 
            </p>
        </i>

        <h3>3 &mdash; Following (Following + Reporting), or Investigation</h3>
        <p>
            And the last tool in the &laquo;Triad&raquo; Investigation 
            allows conducting research and, so to speak, "de jure" formalize "knowledge" 
            in the form of a "report," which can be an article, a thesis, 
            a book, or a comprehensive life work of a scholar. 
            On one hand, it is the "documentary" presentation of the research, 
            while on the other, it is the final summary that can be published
            in a journal or book publishing house.
        </p>
        <i>
            <p>
            (Moreover, Following can be used in government structures, specifically in the ministries of internal affairs of countries, as it 
            also helps conduct investigations, meaning it documents the process).
