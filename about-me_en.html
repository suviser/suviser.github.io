        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            All my life, to be honest, I wanted to be connected with IT. As a child, I called it: "Mom, I want to be a computer science teacher." She still 
            remembers that fondly. Back then, to me, a computer science teacher was the only "IT person", I didn't know that programmers existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            But besides that, I often thought about "hacking", breaking into PCs, etc. The movie "Who Am I?" about a guy with schizophrenia (or maybe not, 
            the ending is open) really stuck with me. As a kid, I was fascinated by this theme, but I never became a hacker, computer science teacher, 
            or programmer. Throughout the years, I always had the cheapest Java phones, and later Android phones like Lenovo, and an old computer from the 
            early 2000s (maybe even older).
        </p>
        <p>
            Somehow, I never started programming seriously. Although, until today, I’ve had a lot of random experiences:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Programming mods for mobile Minecraft in Java when it still had a very limited map. I made vodka and a pickle (I drew and changed just 
                    the icons, names, and properties of existing, but unused items like beets at the time). I also wanted to create a mod that would 
                    automatically build houses, for example, exactly for "survival" mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating websites. I studied HTML and CSS, skills which, by the way, I am now using while creating this website. I’ve started and stopped 
                    countless times. A general understanding remains. I remember searching for free hosting, launching FTP, looking for free domains (I think 
                    it was .fr), and managed to get the site online, although there was no use for it because I didn’t add anything to it or run any blogs. 
                    It was just a fun activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A bit of C++ and Java. I studied them for a while but quickly gave up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And, of course, Python! The king of all kings, the god of all gods, the language of languages! Just kidding, but it was an amazing experience 
                    with automation, regular expressions, making text-based chess, solving the Monty Python problem using classes, and more. For me, Python 
                    is still the language that sets the standard for style. For example, while I’m learning Kotlin and Android Programming, 
                    I constantly compare Kotlin with Python, thinking or saying to myself: why is this implemented like this, why not like that (as in Python), 
                    why are there brackets here? That's just unnecessary text, and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And now, I’m (irregularly) learning to program Android apps in Kotlin. It’s quite interesting, especially JetPack, which makes UI development 
                    a breeze. It’s just a pity that it’s not Python instead of Kotlin.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, I started studying economics, and I got really serious about it, to be honest. I also have a good understanding of business issues, 
            and I even have my own theory (economic, of course) about how to properly create startups. And that's what I'm doing right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to be a real hater of the rich and didn’t even see the point in becoming one. But now my opinion has changed, perhaps due to poor health 
            or awakened desires. But besides that, it’s truly interesting, and I would like to create something big to change the world. Every project I come 
            up with is essentially designed for myself, what would be convenient for me, and then logically thinking and finding examples, I adapt it for 
            others, and even everyone, until I’m convinced that the idea is good and worth pursuing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a sense, I’m just beginning my journey. Right alongside the war. In 2022 — generating and refining ideas, in 2023 — first attempts at 
            implementation (mostly unsuccessful), but I also refined ideas (still doing so), and 2024 — may be the year of change and success! 
            And this success depends not only on me, but on you too! (The reasoning is simple: if you’re not the right fit, you won’t get in the way and will 
            leave, but if you are the right fit — we will create a new world together.)
        </p>
